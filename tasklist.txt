-   Laravel makes it easy for common views to be used by using blade layouts.
-   The .blade.php extension instructs the framework to use the Blade templating engine to render the view
-   "@yield()" - Blade directive that specifies where all child pages that extend the layout can inject their own content.
-   "@extends()" - Tells blade the layout defined in the "resources/views/layouts/app.blade.php" file
